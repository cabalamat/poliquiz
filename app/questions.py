# Questions for Poliquiz

This is the list of questions. Questions are of two types:

(1) agree/disagree, with options that mathematical linear relation to 
    each other.
(2) multi-choice, wih a series of options that have no linear relation.

## Agree/Disagree Questions

These have a range of linear answers from +2 to -2. There is also an option 
of Don't Know, which odesn't count as anything on the linear progression.

() Don't know / Other [--]

related to each other.

Example:

Q: Which of these foods do you most like?
() Strawberries
() Raspberries
() Bananas
() Don't know / Don't care / Other [--]
